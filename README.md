# feature-table
Makes a basic feature table for GenBank submission using a fasta file

The script will prompt the user for gene name, product name, and the translation table to be used. It will then determine the correct reading frame and output a feature table with entries for each sequence. 

To run:
```
python feature-table.py [path-to-fasta-file] [optional-output-file]
```
